# Kiwi TCMS ‚Äì Local Deployment with Docker

This folder provides a ready-to-use Docker Compose configuration for running [Kiwi TCMS](https://kiwitcms.org) locally with persistent storage and HTTPS access. Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system that helps teams organize, execute, and track manual and automated tests.

## Features
- **PostgreSQL 14** as database backend  
- **Kiwi TCMS latest image** as application  
- **Persistent storage** via Docker volumes  
- **HTTPS access** (self-signed certificate)  

## Quick Start

1. Ensure **Docker Desktop** (or Docker + Compose plugin) is running.  
2. From this folder, start the containers:
   docker compose up -d
3. Open in your browser:

https://localhost:8443


The first time you may see a browser warning due to the self-signed certificate. Proceed to continue.

Default credentials

If not changed in docker-compose.yml:

Username: admin

Password: admin

‚ö†Ô∏è For security reasons, change the admin password immediately after first login.

Managing the instance
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f kiwi

# Stop containers (data is preserved)
docker compose down

# Restart containers
docker compose up -d

First steps in Kiwi

Create a Product (e.g. Rainbow Core).

Create a Test Plan and add Test Cases.

Generate an API Token from your user profile (top-right menu ‚Üí API tokens) for CI/CD integration.

Troubleshooting

Verify Docker is running.

Confirm containers are healthy:

docker compose ps


Test connectivity:

curl -kI https://127.0.0.1:8443/


Expect 200 OK or a redirect to /accounts/login/.

If ports are in use, adjust in docker-compose.yml:

ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:8081:8080"   # HTTP
  - "127.0.0.1:8444:8443"   # HTTPS


Then restart with:

docker compose down
docker compose up -d


Access at: https://localhost:8444

Backup & Restore

Data is stored in the Docker volume kiwi_db_data.

Backup:

docker run --rm --volumes-from kiwi-db-1 -v "${PWD}:/backup" ubuntu \
  tar czf /backup/kiwi_db_backup.tgz /var/lib/postgresql/data


Restore (‚ö†Ô∏è overwrites existing data):

docker compose down
docker run --rm --volumes-from kiwi-db-1 -v "${PWD}:/backup" ubuntu \
  bash -lc "rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/* && tar xzf /backup/kiwi_db_backup.tgz -C /"
docker compose up -d

Updating to the Latest Version
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d

Useful commands
# View DB logs
docker compose logs -f db

# Enter Kiwi container shell
docker exec -it kiwi-kiwi-1 sh

After a reboot

Start Docker Desktop

From this folder:

docker compose up -d


Open https://localhost:8443

üéâ Kiwi TCMS is now up and running locally!
